= TrustyAI service


== External endpoints

TrustyAI service external endpoints are only accessible by authenticated users. The authentication is done `oauth-proxy` service.

This generally requires getting a user token (or a token from a service account with sufficient privileges) and passing it to the service.

To get the token on OpenShift, you can use the following command:

```bash
TOKEN=$(oc whoami -t)
```

Then, you can pass the token to the service using the `Authorization` header:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" $TRUSTYAI_ROUTE
```
