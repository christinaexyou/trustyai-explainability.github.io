= Installing on Open Data Hub

This guide will walk through installing Open Data Hub and TrustyAI into your cluster. Starting from a completely
blank cluster, you will be left with:

. An Open Data Hub installation
. A namespace to deploy models into
. A link:TrustyAI-operator.md[TrustyAI Operator], to manage all instances of the link:TrustyAI-service.md[TrustyAI Service]
. A TrustyAI Service, to monitor and analyze all the models deployed into your model namespace.

== Definitions

[horizontal]
$ODH:: Namespace to install ODH into
$PROJECT:: Namespace to deploy models into

== Cluster Setup

. Make sure you are `oc login`'d to your OpenShift cluster.
. Create two projects, `$ODH` and `$PROJECT`.
+
--
These names are arbitrary, but I'll be using them throughout the rest of this demo.
+
[source,shell]
----
oc create project $ODH
oc create project $PROJECT
----
--
. Prepare the `$PROJECT` for ODH's model serving.
+
[source,shell]
----
oc label namespace $PROJECT "modelmesh-enabled=true" --overwrite=true
----

To enable ODH's monitoring stack, `user-workload-monitoring` must be configured.

== Enable User-Workload-Monitoring

. Enable user-workload-monitoring by creating the following `ConfigMap`.
+
[source,yaml]
----
include::example$enable-uwm.yaml[]
----
. Apply the file using.
+
[source,shell]
----
oc apply -f resources/enable_uwm.yaml
----
. Configure user-workload-monitoring to hold metric data for 15 days by creating the following `ConfigMap`.
+
[source,yaml]
----
include::example$uwm_configmap.yaml[]
----
. And applying it with.
+
[source,shell]
----
oc apply -f resources/uwm_configmap.yaml
----

Depending on how your cluster was created, you may need to enable a User Workload Monitoring setting from
your cluster management UI (for example, on console.redhat.com).

== Install ODH Operator

. From the OpenShift Console, navigate to `Operators` > `OperatorHub`, and search for `Open Data Hub`.
+
image::odh_operator_install.png[ODH in OperatorHub, border-effect=line]
. Click on `Open Data Hub Operator`.
+
--
* If the "Show community Operator" warning opens, hit "Continue".
* Hit "Install".
--
. From the "Install Operator" screen.
+
--
* Make sure "All namespaces on the cluster" in selected as the "Installation Mode".
* Hit install.
--
. Wait for the Operator to finish installing.

== ODH v2

[NOTE]
====
Since ODH 2.3.0, TrustyAI is included as an ODH component.

For versions prior to 2.3.0, use the <<_odh-v1,ODH v1>> method.
====

If the provided ODH version in your cluster's OperatorHub is version 2.3.0+, use the following steps:

=== Install ODH (ODH v2.x)

. Navigate to your `opendatahub` project.
. From "Installed Operators", select "Open Data Hub Operator".
. Navigate to the "Data Science Cluster" tab and hit "Create DataScienceCluster".
. In the YAML view Make sure `trustyai` is set to `Managed`.
+
image::odh_V2.png[ODH V2, border-effect=line]
. Hit the "Create" button.
. Within the "Pods" menu, you should begin to see various ODH components being created, including the `trustyai-service-operator-controller-manager-xxx`.

=== Install a TrustyAI service

. Navigate to your `model-namespace` project: `oc project model-namespace`.
. Run `oc apply -f resources/trustyai_crd.yaml`.
+
This will install the TrustyAI Service into your `model-namespace` project, which will then provide TrustyAI features to all subsequent models deployed into that project, such as explainability, fairness monitoring, and data drift monitoring.

== ODH v1

[NOTE]
====
If the provided ODH version in your cluster's OperatorHub is version 1.x, use the following steps.
====

=== Install ODH v1

. Navigate to your `$ODH` project.
. Go to `Installed Operators` > `Open Data Hub Operator` > `KfDef`.
. 
--
* Hit "Create KfDef".
* Hit "Create" without making any changes to the default configuration.
--
. Within the "Pods" menu, you should begin to see various ODH components being created.


=== Install TrustyAI on ODH v1

. Navigate to your `$ODH` project.
+
[source,shell]
----
oc project $ODH
----
. Run `oc apply -f resources/trustyai_operator_kfdef.yaml`.
+
This will install the TrustyAI Operator into your `$ODH` namespace alongside the ODH installation.
. Within the "Pods" menu, you should see the TrustyAI Operator pod being created.
. Navigate to your `$PROJECT` project.
+
[source,shell]
----
oc project $PROJECT
----
. Run `oc apply -f resources/trustyai_crd.yaml`.
+
This will install the TrustyAI Service into your `$PROJECT` project, which will then provide TrustyAI features to all subsequent models deployed into that project, such as explainability, fairness monitoring, and data drift monitoring.
