# Welcome to TrustyAI

TrustyAI is an open source AI Explainability (XAI) Toolkit. It provides a Java and Python library and Open Data Hub (ODH) component for XAI explanations of predictive models for both enterprise and data science.

TrustyAI is avalable as a [Python library](python/index.md) and a Java library and as a [Open Data Hub (ODH) component](service/index.md).

TrustyAI provides a set of explainability algorithms and a set of bias and fairness metrics. The explainability algorithms are used to generate explanations for black-box predictive models. The metrics are used to evaluate potential bias in predictive models.

## Explainers

The explainers provided are explained in more detail in the [explainers overview](algorithms/explainers/index.md) section.

The metrics provided are explained in more detail in the [metrics overview](algorithms/metrics/index.md) section.
