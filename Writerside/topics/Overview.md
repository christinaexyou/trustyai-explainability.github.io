# Overview

## What is TrustyAI?

TrustyAI is, at its core, a Java library and service for Explainable AI (XAI).
TrustyAI offers fairness metrics, explainable AI algorithms, and [various other XAI tools](Features.md) at a library-level as well as a containerized service and Kubernetes deployment.
TrustyAI consists of several [components](Components.md), including:

* [TrustyAI core](TrustyAI-core.md), the core TrustyAI Java module, containing fairness metrics, AI explainers, and other XAI utilities.
* [TrustyAI service](TrustyAI-service.md), TrustyAI-as-a-service, a REST service for fairness metrics and explainability algorithms including ModelMesh integration. 
* [TrustyAI operator](TrustyAI-operator.md), a Kubernetes operator for TrustyAI service.
* [Python TrustyAI](TrustyAI-Python.md), a Python library allowing the usage of TrustyAI's toolkit from Jupyter notebooks

A more detailed explanation of all the components is available in the [Components page](Components.md).
